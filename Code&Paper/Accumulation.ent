macro:->It
is
important
here
to
clarify
our
use
of
the
term
``accumulation.''
We
define
land
accumulation
as
``the
acquisition
or
gradual
gathering
of
land
use
rights
or
land
access
for
purposes
of
agricultural
production.''
Notably,
this
includes
expansion
of
the
farm
unit
via
legal
(e.g.\
ownership,
rental,
or
sharecropping
arrangements)
or
extralegal
(e.g.\
squatting)
means.
As
opposed
to
the
term
farm
growth,
land
accumulation
appears
less
ambiguous
as
farm
growth
can
occur
along
multiple
dimensions
(e.g.\
growth
in
the
quantity
or
value
of
output,
capital
accumulation,
employment
increases,
etc.).
We
do,
however,
use
the
terms
land
accumulation
and
farm
growth
synonymously
throughout.

macro:->In
the
wake

{In\'{e}galit\'{e}s

a
wealth

has
emerged
seeking

test
Gibrat's
Law,
much
of
which

focused
on
the
agricultural
sector
and
farm

growth.
Such
empirical
tests
typically
consist
of
estimating
some
variant

the

$\ln

-
\ln
(x_{i,t-1})
=
\alpha
+
\beta

$x_{i,t}$

of

$i$

$t$,
$\alpha
$
and
$\beta
$
are
parameters
to
be
estimated,
and
$u_{i,t}$
is
the
error
term.

of
